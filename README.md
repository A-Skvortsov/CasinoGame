Gr 11 Intro to CS Mini-Project

Written in Java using NetBeans 8.2 IDE

This is a probability-based mini-game. At the moment, it lacks a GUI and runs only on an IDE console.
The games rules are stated at the beginning of the game: the goal is to accumulate 20 points; 
user starts with 10 points; 
points are won/lost by winning/losing bets that the user places on a random number generator (RNG); 
if the user loses all points, they lose the game; 
the value (in points) of winning/losing a bet is stated at the beginning of each round.
There are three types of bets the user can place: the RNG will pick between two numbers with a range of 7;
the RNG will pick between two numbers with a range of 5;
the RNG will pick a single number.

I have added gameplay images. Enjoy!
